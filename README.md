# Customer-acquisition
Food mart X is a chain of convenience stores in the United States. The private company’s headquarters are in Mentor, Ohio, and currently, approximately 325 stores are in the US. Convenient food mart operates on the franchise system. We are designing an ML-based algorithm for predicting the cost of the media in acquiring customers

### DOMAIN: Retail and Marketing.
### CONTEXT:

Machine Learning helps retailers to predict the future through simulating scenarios that predetermine the outcomes and identify
the crucial action areas. In Cost prediction on acquiring customers, we need to predict the cost of media campaigns in food mart of
USA. In this challenge, you’re required to build an ML model to predict the media cost based on the customer’s details, product
details, promotion details, and store details.
### DATA DESCRIPTION:

 Food mart X is a chain of convenience stores in the United States. The private company’s headquarters are in Mentor,
Ohio, and currently, approximately 325 stores are in the US. Convenient food mart operates on the franchise system.
